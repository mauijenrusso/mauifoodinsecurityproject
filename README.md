maui food insecurity project for ICS 173, 

I took a look at data on the number of farms in the state of Hawaii and the amount of food produced in pounds in Hawaii. 

There is a lack of data when it comes to looking into agricultural data. The amount of food produced data ends in 2017 as the most updated year to obtain this data. The number of farms were only counted in 1982, 1987, 92, 97, 02, and 07, and 2012.

I did a bar graph of the amount of food produced, a 2 year moving average, and exponential smoothing graphs on amount of food produced

The data was obtained https://opendata.hawaii.gov/

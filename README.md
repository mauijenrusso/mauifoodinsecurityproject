I took a look at data on the number of farms in the state of Hawaii and the amount of food produced in pounds in Hawaii. 

There is a lack of data when it comes to looking into agricultural data. The amount of food produced data ends in 2017 as the most updated year to obtain this data. The number of farms were only counted in 1982, 1987, 92, 97, 02, and 07, and 2012.

I did a bar graph of the amount of food produced, a 2 year moving average, and exponential smoothing graphs on amount of food produced

The data was obtained https://opendata.hawaii.gov/

My questions:  Is the amount of food produced in state declining? Is it related to a declining number of farms?

The amount of food produced is declining. It is on a downward trend.

Is it related to the number of farms? According to the data on the years collected on farms, the farms had a sharp upward trend in numbers from the late nineties through the first decade of the 2000's.  Food production saw a huge decline from the late nineties through the first decade of the 2000's. 

More data is needed, but this would indicate all though there are more farms, perhaps they are gentlemen's estates that are not creating enough food into the production cycle, or other small farm operations, versus our larger export farm operations like sugar cane and pineapple that have ceased production.

This is interesting stuff, and I plan to continue looking at agricultural data. Hopefully creating some geomaps next.
